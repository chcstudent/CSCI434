			Playing the Game
		</h1>
		<br>
		<p>
			<b>Shattered</b> starts with the players. As it's a cooperative experience, you need people to play with you.
			We recommend a group of 4 - 6, but smaller and larger groups are both possible. Once you have players, you need 
			some equipment:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://shop.neverdarkenough.com/">The Shattered Book or PDF</a></li>
				<li><a>Dice</a></li>
				<li><a>Character Sheets</a></li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			Once you have your group and your gear, it's time to nominate a <b>GM</b>: a Game Master. Their job will be to 
			keep the game running smoothly and handle everything that isn't a player character- the narrative, setting, monsters
			and so forth. This is a lot of work, but can be very rewarding in its own way. 
			<br>
			After that, it's time to start creating characters. So let's get out those character sheets and give it a shot!
