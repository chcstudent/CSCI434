    <p><b>Welcome!</b> I'm Cory Conrad, a man of many trades. I've worked in fast food and a frozen storage warehouse. In the Air Force I was an airborne cryptolinguist (Arabic), 
      and post-Air Force I've provided near real-time analysis of full-motion video. Currently, I provide training simulations for my former linguist colleagues. More important
      to me than those job titles, however, is my <i>passion</i>. With a handful of my friends, I have developed and published a tabletop roleplaying game, <a href="https://neverdarkenough.com/">Shattered</a>.
      My latest blessing is the opportunity to officially label myself an <b>editor</b> of a novel soon to be published by my close friend and fellow developer, Josh "Zip" Pietrzykowski.

    <h2>What's a Tabletop RPG?</h2>
    <p>
      A tabletop RPG (roleplaying game) is a cooperative experience, where players collaborate to tell a story of adventure, danger, and intrigue. The most popular example is 
      <a href"https://www.dndbeyond.com/">Dungeons and Dragons</a>, but it would be unfair to the genre to say they're all the same, just like saying all novels or all movies are the same. There is as much nuance 
      among tabletop RPGs as exists between book genres or film categories. But there are 3 main elements to every tabletop RPG: Storytelling, Setting, and Mechanics.
      <br>
      <b>Storytelling</b> refers to how the players tell the story. The most popular option is a <i>Game Master</i>. They serve as a narrator to the game's events, driving the plot
      and managing story elements such as setting and characters that aren't controlled by the other players. This is the method Shattered uses, but it's not the only option. 
      <br>
      <b>Setting</b> is simply that: where the game takes place. Medieval Fantasy is a popular setting, often borrowing elements from European history and mythology. Your "knights
      in shining armor" and all that. Shattered is set in an entirely original world named <i>Feneryss</i> that is slowly recovering from a cataclysmic event. Its denizens face many
      struggles: the Undead Tide, eldritch abominations, manic weather patterns, and much more.
      <br>
      <b>Mechanics</b> refers to how players interact with the game elements. Many games use dice. Shattered is one of them. Many others, however, use a deck of cards. Some even have
      unique cards or dice sets that are specifically crafted for their mechanics, such as <a href="https://fate-srd.com/">FATE</a>. As stated, Shattered uses dice, and not just the
      dice most people know, with six sides. We use four-, six-, eight- and ten-sided dice together to represent a character's skill (or lack thereof) whenever they perform actions that
      have meaningful consequences for success and failure.
