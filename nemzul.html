            Nemzul's Bestiary
        </h1>
        <p>
            In an effort to aid his fellow Feneryans, one man has made it his life's work to classify, catalog, and characterize the many terrifying creatures and eldritch horrors that now share the broken world with mankind. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Bardic Nemzul is, by most accounts, a madman with a death wish, but his efforts are nevertheless lauded by any and all who venture outside the safety of Feneryss's city-states. His detailed drawings and firsthand accounts are unparalleled.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also unparalleled is his wild fortune: he has narrowly avoided death and experienced firsthand encounters that should have left him dead a hundred times over; on the other hand, his poor luck with love has left a frightening body count in his wake. A widower by monster, disease, and a bad fall- to name just a few- it is probably best to keep your distance from this man.
